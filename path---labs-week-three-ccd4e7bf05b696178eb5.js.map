And I think it is worth mentioning here. This code was pushed by one of our developers as a solution to a problem, and it is a solution that works. However, as you may notice, this code is rather strange. It’s an arrow function which does not need explicit curly brackets <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">{...}</code>, despite having them. When these brackets are added to arrow functions, the implication is that a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">return</code> will indicate the end of the function call, and there is no return.</p>\\n<p>For this reason, our code was throwing a warning in the console whenever this component rendered, which is what brought it to my attention. And this is where the intent of this code gets interesting. We are inside a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.map()</code> method on an array of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">things</code>, and with these combined premises, something very odd begins to develop: <strong>the code could be intended for many very different purposes</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps most obviously, the purpose of the code could be to change the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">updatedAt</code> key on the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">thing</code> object to a human readable date, if it exists. However, when implemented with a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.map()</code> in this way, this becomes problematic. What is this code actually doing? It is returning <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">undefined</code> <strong>in place of the object <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">thing</code> for all the things</strong>. Because it is a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.map()</code>, it is editing the variables in memory and thus we can discard the return.</p>\\n<p>Wait what?</p>\\n<p>If this is the purpose of this code, then a fix of the console warning might look like this:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 36.66666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"A Potential Fix\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-1eceb.png 1050w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-5aa17.png 1140w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>A Potential Fix</em></p>\\n<p>However, as you may realize, this forces a perceived obsolescence of the aforementioned purpose of this code, as the updated date should then re-write <strong>the entire rest of the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">thing</code> object with a date</strong> (which it doesn’t do). Consequently, I created a pull request with my potential solution, and while reviewing it with my team I brought up these issues. It was obvious to all what the code was supposed to do—edit the date format, and considering it was working, it was hard to convince anyone of the inherent problem. Namely, this code obfuscates its intended purpose. It communicates poorly to future developers what it’s purpose is.</p>\\n<p>Our final code will probably look something like this:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 24.34077079107505%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAA+ElEQVQY042QS47DIBBEfZJJgjENxmBjDP4lzkdRNPe/UE3bi5ntLJ5oPRCtquK6Jmxrxm0akCfCMmncYok+dwiDh9EljBKoawHL1OoCy87aip1E0yg4p2CMANEFhTMVls7je8jYhhav94rP+4rnc8VrW7DkBqkjpMlh3jrMwWPLEQ++3998Pg/ctxUjO2slCsNbNA/94JByQEot8tjDGYkgSsQkEFcNGwPq2KGNDkPyyJxgHMNx2prQtQ7eE4pgCTMRAstp7llqSPkF0gKKYyiOq+QZpE4HSp0Pqur0yx51d8R1FL4h7oW7MeXRx96L5s8OSPzN/+QHd+6YWrUEd6AAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Potential Final Code\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-cdf30.png 986w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>A potential Final Solution</em></p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Part 2 - Feature Complete</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to convert a disparate set of components into a single, cohesive, and complete product.

And I think it is worth mentioning here. This code was pushed by one of our developers as a solution to a problem, and it is a solution that works. However, as you may notice, this code is rather strange. It’s an arrow function which does not need explicit curly brackets <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">{...}</code>, despite having them. When these brackets are added to arrow functions, the implication is that a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">return</code> will indicate the end of the function call, and there is no return.</p>\\n<p>For this reason, our code was throwing a warning in the console whenever this component rendered, which is what brought it to my attention. And this is where the intent of this code gets interesting. We are inside a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.map()</code> method on an array of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">things</code>, and with these combined premises, something very odd begins to develop: <strong>the code could be intended for many very different purposes</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps most obviously, the purpose of the code could be to change the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">updatedAt</code> key on the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">thing</code> object to a human readable date, if it exists. However, when implemented with a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.map()</code> in this way, this becomes problematic. What is this code actually doing? It is returning <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">undefined</code> <strong>in place of the object <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">thing</code> for all the things</strong>. Because it is a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.map()</code>, it is editing the variables in memory and thus we can discard the return.</p>\\n<p>Wait what?</p>\\n<p>If this is the purpose of this code, then a fix of the console warning might look like this:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 36.66666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAHCAYAAAAIy204AAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAABd0lEQVQozy2O2XKbQBBF+f/PSiWVqlgilo3YJBmxiHVGA2hHy0mD83Cqe7rv3NuWiWLKYE2x+EQ5EcoX1l+cvRXXvGSoFWjDXWnutYa6kaqmftwNRc1TdLQ9r32LNTaYjuvqiyHcYPyQreMS2u/4MxvtBdxWMZmbES5jKj8h/nSJ5ADvzWb1Z4Zy1/RJAY0Ww2bPyKuS9P74nV423CT5Ucl1yvAq5brSMFSGq/AQ7bgfCrlWNPemZcjrycfKozW62mGagk4ret1wMGJ4bLmeOs5HMTm13ITL/3qT+e3cCx2XgxH2XER/lt5aHVPcNsJLHII4ZBZ7/M2WOKVP2Mfk15zglLPsM7JDQtBF+N0WR62nWmDI2bNDT1ilDEaSIScaUn6oOb/iOfbOZZ46eHpDYrYEZYxbpbxVGXYd8567LAqfhQS7Yu72Y+gWK33U7F6Kj/uG+RDwu//gZ2WT3CuyR0Mq5M8RRfrUE9lLT38ymY+60SN7fr//AdI6CTx/SR75AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"A Potential Fix\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-1eceb.png 1050w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-02-28_at_3.42.43_PM-b3a8b9d6da8698d0afb973dc8fd5ebfd-5aa17.png 1140w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>A Potential Fix</em></p>\\n<p>However, as you may realize, this forces a perceived obsolescence of the aforementioned purpose of this code, as the updated date should then re-write <strong>the entire rest of the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">thing</code> object with a date</strong> (which it doesn’t do). Consequently, I created a pull request with my potential solution, and while reviewing it with my team I brought up these issues. It was obvious to all what the code was supposed to do—edit the date format, and considering it was working, it was hard to convince anyone of the inherent problem. Namely, this code obfuscates its intended purpose. It communicates poorly to future developers what it’s purpose is.</p>\\n<p>Our final code will probably look something like this:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 24.34077079107505%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAA+ElEQVQY042QS47DIBBEfZJJgjENxmBjDP4lzkdRNPe/UE3bi5ntLJ5oPRCtquK6Jmxrxm0akCfCMmncYok+dwiDh9EljBKoawHL1OoCy87aip1E0yg4p2CMANEFhTMVls7je8jYhhav94rP+4rnc8VrW7DkBqkjpMlh3jrMwWPLEQ++3998Pg/ctxUjO2slCsNbNA/94JByQEot8tjDGYkgSsQkEFcNGwPq2KGNDkPyyJxgHMNx2prQtQ7eE4pgCTMRAstp7llqSPkF0gKKYyiOq+QZpE4HSp0Pqur0yx51d8R1FL4h7oW7MeXRx96L5s8OSPzN/+QHd+6YWrUEd6AAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Potential Final Code\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_8.58.47_AM-2693c51891a17e2b29d4770e6a71d217-cdf30.png 986w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>A potential Final Solution</em></p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Part 2 - Feature Complete</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to convert a disparate set of components into a single, cohesive, and complete product.
