We spent most of the week trying to make up the technical debt we inherited from a project built on graphQL and mongoDB, two frameworks which no one in our group understood on Monday. However, here on Friday, I have deployed this very blog using graphQL.</p>\n<h3>WhAt aM I dOiNg</h3>\n<p>As the self-proclaimed team organizational lead, last week, I took it upon myself to assign roles in our group and attempt to divide labor up and define rolls. I also lightly influenced the composition of our team by recruiting some of the best developers in our program in the fields our team composition may have been lacking in.</p>\n<h3>TDD</h3>\n<p>As a group we (mostly my awesome team) authored our Technical Design Document on Monday and Tuesday, to meet our specifications. My personal contribution to this was giving the final read over and presenting the document and our plan to our Client in a 15 minute (ish) presentation.</p>\n<p>In preparation for this, we played around with competitive products and got a feel for the kind of experience we were tasked with building.</p>\n<p>We were accepted immediately, and moved onto development.</p>\n<h3>Study</h3>\n<p>Upon gaining access to the repository, we began the long slog up hill trying to wrap our heads around the entirely foreign tech stack we now had to digest in days. In pursuit of this, much of time I spent this week was working through <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/basics/2-core-concepts/">this tutorial</a> on graphQL, which is excellent.</p>\n<h3>Deploy</h3>\n<p>It took us Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday to re-deploy the app (and rebuild our understanding) but we got it done.</p>\n<p><a href="http://team-home-2-graphql-mongodb.herokuapp.com">Server</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://team-home-2.netlify.com">Front End</a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, issues with Auth0 have been preventing us from logging in. We haev created a few work around solutions — including depricating all the authentication logic and code (yikes) — but we hope to soon find a solution here.</p>\n<p>Seeing as how this project was given to us as a completed project, we did not need to build or touch any of the user models.</p>'}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
