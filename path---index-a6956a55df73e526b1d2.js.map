I was really worried because I had been putting off looking for an internship over Summer. I wanted to get some experience during my break, so I set out on an intense plan to find a placement.</p>\\n<p>In this post, I’ll outline the steps that I went through to find a company that would offer me a placement. Hopefully, you can take these steps to help you with your own internship search.</p>\\n<h2>1. Research potential placements</h2>\\n<p>After my exams, I spent several days straight researching potential places to work.</p>\\n<p>The majority of smaller companies will not outright ask for interns. As a result, it’s important to know that <strong>you</strong> need to put in the effort to get in contact with companies.</p>\\n<p>I used job websites like indeed.com and LinkedIn to look for normal jobs that have a similar area of experience that I have or want to expand on.</p>\\n<p>As a data nerd, I made a spreadsheet of companies that I could work for. Even if I didn’t want to work at a particular place I’d put it in the spreadsheet for completion.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 53.99543378995434%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"A preview of my spreadsheet\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-1eceb.png 1050w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-f5de9.png 1400w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-704c7.png 1752w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>A preview of part of my spreadsheet</em></p>\\n<p>I ended up having a list of over 10 companies. The more places you ask the higher your chance of getting a response. Quantity is important, especially if you live in an area like me where there are not that many tech opportunities available.</p>\\n<h2>2. Reaching out</h2>\\n<p>After making my spreadsheet, the next step was to contact all of the companies that interest you.</p>\\n<p>While you could phone a company, email is much preferred. This will give you time to plan what you want to say as best as you can. It also lets whoever receives the email to reply back when they get the time.</p>\\n<p>Since a lot of emails are of the same format, I found it would be easier to build an email template. My template contained information including who I was, why I was contacting them and what I could do for them.</p>\\n<p>Now here is the most important part. Rather than sending the same email to each company talking about why you’re so great (I’m sure you are), don’t forget that there’s a person on the other side of the email. People can spot the difference between a spam email and a genuine one. That’s why it’s important to tailor your email and make it as custom to the company as possible. This involves being honest and saying why you like the company, why you would be a good fit and what you could offer them.</p>\\n<p>If you want an idea of what you can write, here is the email template I used:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>\\n<p>My name is Pav Sidhu from Cardiff. I am currently an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham. I finish university at the end of June and I am looking for an internship opportunity over Summer.</p>\\n<p>(Insert why I like the company, why I would be a good fit and what you could do for them.)</p>\\n<p>I have several years of web development experience which I have outlined on the attached CV however to outline my technological skills:</p>\\n<p>Front-end: HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript (ES6, React, jQuery, AJAX)\\nBack-end: Node.js, Python, Java, SQL, GraphQL</p>\\n<p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this, I would love to spend 15 minutes or so to discuss such an opportunity.</p>\\n<p>Regards,</p>\\n<p>Pav Sidhu</p>\\n<p>Phone: +01 2345 67890</p>\\n<p>Website: <a href=\\\"https://pavsidhu.com/\\\">https://pavsidhu.com</a></p>\\n<p>Blog: <a href=\\\"https://blog.pavsidhu.com/\\\">https://blog.pavsidhu.com</a></p>\\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\\\"https://github.com/pavsidhu\\\">https://github.com/pavsidhu</a></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Remember to keep your email short and sweet, the person reading this doesn’t want to hear about all your achievements, no matter how great they are.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, proofread your emails. I used <a href=\\\"grammarly.com\\\">Grammarly</a> to check for grammar errors and <a href=\\\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\\\">Hemingway editor</a> to ensure my writing was clear.</p>\\n<p>Don’t forget to attach your CV so if a company is interested they read more about your skills in more detail. I can’t tell you how many times I almost forgot to attach mine 😅.</p>\\n<p>I sent my emails on Sunday night. This means that on Monday morning, the first thing they see will be your email. Unless you have to, try not to send it on any other day. Even if you may have been a great fit they wouldn’t know because they might miss your email!</p>\\n<h2>3. Waiting for a response</h2>\\n<p>The first thing to note is that a potential intern is not a companies number one priority so don’t always expect a reply back any time soon. To be safe I would wait a week or two for a response. If you don’t receive anything, send a polite email asking if they received your email.</p>\\n<p>Not all companies have the time to respond so only a few, if any, will reply.</p>\\n<p>If you have gotten a response, you will likely send a few emails back and forth to discuss a potential phone call or meeting to see if you are a good fit.</p>\\n<p>I was lucky when getting my internship. I was called into the office to have a chat to see what I could do for the company and what I could get out of it. Small companies are less predictable, so some companies may have an interview process while others may not.</p>\\n<p>If everything works out you’ve got yourself an internship, congrats! 🎉🎉🎉</p>\\n<h2>4. One Last Controversial Point</h2>\\n<p>Working for free is not something that everybody agrees on. I believe that you shouldn’t feel entitled to be paid a salary if you have little to no experience.</p>\\n<p>If you can afford it and you enjoy what you’re doing, you should be happy working for free. The company is doing you a favour by taking a risk and giving you experience.</p>\\n<p>As a student, I know the importance of money however it doesn’t get easier when you’re older with a mortgage and bills. Take the opportunity now to get experience while you can, it’ll help you out in the long run.</p>\\n<p>If you or the company you work for thinks you are doing a good job, you could discuss potential pay with them.</p>\\n<h2>Some Final Tips</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Although I procrastinated and left my search till late, start your search early. You will have a greater chance of getting an internship, especially if you’re going for bigger companies, though that’s a different game altogether.</li>\\n<li>If you can do your work without much support from others, startups are more likely to take you on. As startups are usually growing at a rapid pace, they need all the help they can get. If you have the skills they will be keen to have you join their team.</li>\\n<li>Be polite, remember that someone is taking time out of their busy work schedule to help you.</li>\\n<li>Getting an internship is hard, my internship success came with a mix of hard work and luck. If a company ignores or rejects you, don’t feel discouraged its part of the process.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Good luck with your search! I would love to hear if you manage to get an internship. Send me a message on Twitter @Pav_Sidhu 😄.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/how-i-built-my-blog-using-gatsby-and-netlify\",\"date\":\"28th May 2018\",\"title\":\"How I Built My Blog Using Gatsby and Netlify\"},\"excerpt\":\"Can you name a more iconic duo? 🤔 Years ago, when I would build a static website, I wouldn’t use any fancy frameworks or build tools.

The only thing I would bring into my projects would be jQuery or if I was feeling extra fancy I would use Sass.</p>\\n<p>Nowadays, we have tools like Gatsby and Netlify which greatly improve the experience of building static websites. Rather than thinking about boilerplate and configuration (looking at you Webpack) you can just focus on your application.</p>\\n<p>I wouldn’t hesitate to say that the Gatsby and Netlify flow is the best programming experience I’ve ever had. Let me explain why.</p>\\n<h2>Gatsby</h2>\\n<p>Gatsby is a static site generator that uses React. Everything is configured out of the box including React, Webpack, Prettier and more.</p>\\n<p>Since Gatsby builds on top of React, you get all the benefits of React such as its performance, components, JSX, React library ecosystem and a large community (React is nearing 100,000 stars on GitHub 😱).</p>\\n<p>If you haven’t used React before there is a learning curve but there are plenty of well written tutorials that makes learning React very accessible. Not to mention the <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/\\\">official React documentation</a> is very well written.</p>\\n<p>For many static websites like my blog, I need to use external data sources (my actual blog posts) during the build process. Gatsby provides support for many forms of data, including Markdown, APIs, Databases and CMSs like WordPress. To access this data, Gatsby uses GraphQL.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 87.20930232558139%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Gatsby flow\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-23179.png 860w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>Taken straight from the Gatsby website</em></p>\\n<p>All my blog posts are in Markdown, so I’m using a Gatsby plugin <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/?=gatsby-transformer-remark\\\">gatsby-transformer-remark</a> that allows you to query your Markdown files using GraphQL.

If GraphQL is new to you, it does add yet another thing to learn, however, the documentation on using GraphQL with Gatsby has plenty of information and code snippets that you can use.</p>\\n<p>If you are building a simple blog like mine and there are only one or two queries you need to make, there are Gatsby starter kits that already set up gatsby-transformer-remark and all the querying for you. To speed up development I used one called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/noahg/gatsby-starter-blog-no-styles/\\\">gatsby-starter-blog-no-styles</a>.</p>\\n<p>I am a huge fan of styled-components so I used it when building this blog. I did encounter an issue with styling my blog posts since there was no way to specify to gatsby-transformer-remark how to style your components. Instead I had to use plain CSS for styling.

Each guide in the docs explain concepts of Gatsby so well, it’s likely that in most cases you won’t need to check any third party source of information.</p>\\n<p>The only difficulty I came across when using Gatbsy was when I deployed my website I had a FOUC (flash of unstyled content). To fix this issue I found that upgrading Gatsby from 1.8.12 to 1.9.250 fixed the issue. I’m not too sure why this fixed it, I assume it must have been an internal issue with Gatsby.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 62.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"fouc.png\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-1eceb.png 1050w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-f5de9.png 1400w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-a1d38.png 2100w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-b65a5.png 2880w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>I mean who really wants to see my forehead?</em></p>\\n<h2>Netlify</h2>\\n<p>Usually, when building a static website, I’ll use GitHub pages because it’s free and fairly easy to set up. Although I still think GitHub pages is a great tool, Netlify takes the process one step further to make the developer experience even more efficient.</p>\\n<p>Once you’ve <a href=\\\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/\\\">hooked up Netlify to your repo</a>, each push to your GitHub repository, automatically builds your website, according to the static site generator you’re using, and deploys it to production.</p>\\n<p>Although I currently only use Netlify for static site hosting, it supports cloud functions, domain management (with SSL), form submissions, a/b testing and more.</p>\\n<p>Besides features, Netlify’s web interface is clean and easy to use. Coming from using AWS a lot in past projects, the difference is night and day. While AWS has it’s advantages being highly configurable, the large portion of us developers are unlikely to use this functionality. When I first used S3 or Lambda (Amazon’s static file and cloud function services) I would spend a considerable amount of time looking up Amazon’s difficult and sometimes out of date documentation. There is a whole lot of unneeded complexity and Amazon jargon when using AWS which is why Netlify is a breath of fresh air. It’s one of those services that <em>just</em> works.</p>\\n<p>The best part about Netlify is that it’s free. If you’re in a large team or need more resources for cloud functions, form submissions and more they do have paid options. If you plan on building a small blog like me, it’s unlikely you’ll need to pay for anything.</p>\\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\\n<p>Gatsby and Netlify are the easiest way to build and publish a static website. Period.</p>\\n<p>If you would like an example of how to build a blog using Gatsby, the code for my blog is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/pavsidhu/blog\\\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/docker-an-explanation-for-beginners\",\"date\":\"12th August 2017\",\"title\":\"🐳 Docker: An Explanation for Beginners\"},\"excerpt\":\"During the 6 years I’ve been programming, I’ve discovered a pattern when learning something new.

At first what you’re learning feels impossible to understand. It isn’t until afterwards, you realise it wasn’t actually that difficult all along. Docker is no exception of this pattern.</p>\\n<p>In this post, I aim to answer all the questions I had when first learning Docker. Please note that this isn’t a technical tutorial as such, it’s an explanation of the world of Docker. If it’s a tutorial that you’re after I’ve linked a couple of my favourites at the end of this article.</p>\\n<h2>What’s the problem that Docker aims to solve?</h2>\\n<p>While Docker solves a lot of things, its main selling point is that it improves consistency.</p>\\n<p>When a group of people are working on the same application, there can be inconsistencies with operating systems and setups. This can lead to a bunch of different issues.</p>\\n<p>There may even be inconsistencies when running your application on your own computer and on your production server.</p>\\n<p>All these issues take you away from solving the actual problem, which is building your application.</p>\\n<h2>So, how does Docker solve this?</h2>\\n<p>Docker has a thing they call containers. They are like Linux virtual machines but they are very efficient and use fewer resources. Your application can be run inside its own isolated container with a consistent environment.</p>\\n<p>A container which includes your application can be run on Windows, MacOS or Linux. This removes any of the quirks that come with developers having different operating systems and setups on their computer.</p>\\n<p>Docker’s ability to keep a consistent environment makes your application very portable.</p>\\n<h2>But where do I get these containers?</h2>\\n<p>Docker has a place where you are able to download containers called Docker Hub.</p>\\n<p>While you can create your own container from scratch the likelihood of you needing to is low. By downloading a container which already has already been setup, you can start building your application sooner.</p>\\n<p>A few examples of containers that you can download from Docker Hub include <a href=\\\"https://hub.docker.com/_/node/\\\">Node.js</a>, <a href=\\\"https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/\\\">MySQL</a> or even <a href=\\\"https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/\\\">Ubuntu</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I add my app to the container?</h2>\\n<p>Once you’ve found the container that you want, you’ll want to be able to customise it to add your application, setup dependencies and more. This is where a Dockerfile comes in.</p>\\n<p>A Dockerfile, in short, explains how you want Docker to set up your container when it first loads. This is how a basic Dockerfile for a Node.js application might look like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\"># Use the official Node.js runtime as a base image\\nFROM node:alpine\\n\\n# Set the directory of my web application to /app\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy over my project’s directory into the container /app folder\\nAdd . /app\\n\\n# Install all the dependencies for my web application\\nRUN yarn install\\n\\n# Make the port 3000 accessible outside of Docker\\nEXPOSE 3000\\n\\n# Execute the command yarn start\\nCMD [&quot;yarn&quot;, &quot;start&quot;]</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This Dockerfile will now run whenever an instance of the container is being built. Yet to create a container you need to create a Docker image. Once you create the image, you can use it to create as many containers as you wish.</p>\\n<h2>So I need only a single container for my whole app?</h2>\\n<p>While you can do this, it’s best practice to isolate parts of your application into different containers.</p>\\n<p>For example, a web application that requires a Python web server and a database should have two containers rather than one. The first should be for your Python server and the second for your database.</p>\\n<p>Why? It makes your application more modular. If your application grows in the future or has random spikes in traffic, you can spin up several Python server instances to share the load.</p>\\n<h2>Can’t it get difficult managing different containers at the same time?</h2>\\n<p>Yup. That’s why Docker created another tool called Docker Compose. It allows you to specify the configuration of Docker containers that rely on each other in one file. A Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) may look something like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">version: &#39;2&#39;\\nservices:\\n  server:\\n    build: .\\n    ports:\\n      - &quot;3000:3000&quot;\\n    volumes:\\n      - .:/app\\n  database:\\n    image: &quot;mariadb:10.3&quot;\\n    environment:\\n      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=MyPassword\\n      - MYSQL_DATABASE=MyDatabase\\n    ports:\\n      - &quot;3306:3306&quot;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As you might see, we’ve created two services (or containers), one named server and another named database. I’ve specified the ports, environment variables and other information.</p>\\n<p>Once you’ve set up the docker-compose.yml file it becomes easier to manage a group of containers for a single application.</p>\\n<h2>What else is there that I should know?</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Kitematic:</strong> This is a program that allows you to manage containers through a visual interface. I would recommend you use this in the beginning since setting up containers in the command line can be overwhelming.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Docker Swarm:</strong> When your application grows, you might want to have several containers that handle your traffic. Docker Swarm makes it easier to manage groups of containers (called clusters) at a time. This is something you should consider implementing in the future.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<p>Here are a couple of the resources that I found useful when learning Docker myself:</p>\\n<p>The Docker docs of course, though I found them to be intimidating for beginners. <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/get-started\\\">Get Started, Part 1: Orientation and setup</a></p>\\n<p>DigitalOcean has some brilliant resources.

This was quite a scary thought at first but after researching and going back and forth between closed source and open source, I ended up going for the latter. Here are 5 reasons why I will open source my app.</p>\\n<h2>1. Give back to the community</h2>\\n<p>When developers tell you that they were ‘self-taught’, they are most definitely wrong. Self-taught developers have been trained by the millions of people that have written blog posts, created videos, build documentation and open sourced their code.</p>\\n<p>These people have given so much value to you, they have spent countless hours building stuff to support your progression as a developer so you should do the same.</p>\\n<p>Yes, open sourcing your project will take a small amount of your time but the advantages that it has on others (and you) far outweigh this issue.</p>\\n<h2>2. Build better code</h2>\\n<p>When open sourcing an app, you need to make sure that your code is understandable by other developers. This means that you must write clear code and simple documentation.</p>\\n<p>Especially for those like me who are building a project alone, it’s easy to skip documentation since you know what you’ve built and have forgotten the learning curve required if another developer decided to join your project. Even in a team, developers may regard something as being common sense when someone new may not have a clue.</p>\\n<p>When you open up your project for other developers to peer into, it forces you to think differently. <em>Is this code easy to understand? Should my documentation be clearer? How can this be made simpler?</em></p>\\n<p>I think some developers (myself included) can become lazy with building readable code. This mindset shift when you realise that someone you’ve never met should be able to understand your code is a drastic advantage to building maintainable and sustainable code.</p>\\n<h2>3. Nobody can steal your business</h2>\\n<p>One of the reasons why I considered not to open source my app was because I worried that someone could take my code and ‘copy’ my idea.</p>\\n<p>Since developers spend lots of time and effort into their projects, there is a fear that someone will steal your hard work if you were to open source. I came to a sudden realisation that it doesn’t matter.</p>\\n<p><strong>There’s more to a business than just code, the community you build is something which others simply can’t copy.</strong></p>\\n<p>It can be difficult when you have lots of pride in your work but spending the time to build your following and interact with your community will ensure that you have something which no other business can emulate.</p>\\n<p>If you’re worried that a competitor will copy your idea, then remember that they can still copy your idea if your code isn’t available to them. Even so, it doesn’t make it easier when you code is open sourced since they have to remodel your idea to work with their project.</p>\\n<h2>4. Free tools!</h2>\\n<p>Some businesses in the development space like to give back to the open source community, so they give away their tools for free.</p>\\n<p>The biggest of these tools is clearly <a href=\\\"https://github.com/\\\">GitHub</a>. It’s solid platform and 14 million users (as of April 2016) shows that it’s the best place to host your project.</p>\\n<p>Another popular tool is <a href=\\\"https://travis-ci.org/\\\">Travis CI</a> which makes testing your project straightforward. Almost every project I see on GitHub uses Travis CI. Its setup is incredibly simple and is hosted for you for free if your project is open source.</p>\\n<p>One last tool is <a href=\\\"https://canny.io/\\\">Canny</a> (it used to be called Product Pains) which helps you to interact with your community and discover areas in your project that can be improved. The only downside to using this tool is that they only allow you to go for their open source plan if you aren’t a product, meaning that your project should be for helping the development community.</p>\\n<p>There are several other tools which are free if you are open source, I recommend you research what tools you need and check if there is a free open source solution.</p>\\n<h2>5. Learn from your community</h2>\\n<p>When working on a project in isolation, you’re limited to your ideas and knowledge. This can be a hindrance to your business, which is why more companies are listening to their communities by open sourcing their products. Companies like Facebook and Google are at the forefront of open source but even non-tech companies are doing this. If this isn’t a sign that open source is here <strong>now</strong>, then I don’t know what will be.</p>\\n<p>By releasing your code to the public, you show that you care. While the community for my project isn’t necessarily developers, there are developers who care about the same issues as you do. Their ideas can help shape your product for the better and improve your business.</p>\\n<p>While open source is difficult in the short term, it’s the benefits in the long term that will make your efforts worthwhile.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/whats-happening-with-navigation-in-react-native\",\"date\":\"19th February 2017\",\"title\":\"What’s Happening with Navigation in React Native?\"},\"excerpt\":\"When I began learning React Native the docs and developers said that to handle navigation between scenes in your app you should use  Navigator  and a depreciated component,  NavigatorIOS , was no longer recommended. After I began using…\",\"html\":\"<p>When I began learning React Native the docs and developers said that to handle navigation between scenes in your app you should use <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html\\\">Navigator</a> and a depreciated component, <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigatorios.html\\\">NavigatorIOS</a>, was no longer recommended. After I began using Navigator, I found out about another component, <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html#navigationexperimental\\\">NavigationExperimental</a>, which was being developed to replace Navigator. After seeing a <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/5ufr1h/why_is_navigation_in_react_native_such_a_big_mess/\\\">post</a> on the React Native subreddit and then doing some digging, I found out that Navigator and NavigationExperimental will be depreciated in favour of one last library <a href=\\\"https://reactnavigation.org/\\\">React-Navigation</a>. It’s all a bit of a mess but I will clear everything up from what I’ve found while building my app.</p>\\n<h2>NavigatorIOS</h2>\\n<p>The first solution to navigation in React Native was NavigatorIOS. As the name suggests, it only works on iOS, since it was built before React Native supported Android. While it uses the native navigation bar in iOS, NavigatorIOS has multiple bugs which have not been fixed and the lack of customisation of the appearance of the navigation bar can be difficult to style the app the way you would like. I can’t imagine anyone wanting to use this for a new project.</p>\\n<h2>Navigator</h2>\\n<p>Navigator was built to replace NavigatorIOS. Since it isn’t native and uses Javascript, it is supported on iOS and Android. It is more customisable than NavigatorIOS, but animations are slower since it isn’t native. <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/using-navigators.html\\\">The docs still use Navigator</a> to introduce new developers to React Native however, it is being depreciated, so if you plan on building an app or have just begun, it isn’t recommended.</p>\\n<h2>NavigationExperimental</h2>\\n<p>NavigationExperimental was developed to add several improvements the Navigator. Since using Navigator can lead to code being messy and difficult to understand, NavigationExperimental uses single directional data flow to navigate through scenes (basically it supports <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a>). It also keeps the navigation code separate from the view logic. The only issue with NavigationExperimental is that while you get more control, the setup and usage is a bit more difficult. Like NavigatorIOS and Navigator, NavigationExperimental is being <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Roadmap\\\">depreciated</a>.</p>\\n<h2>React Navigation</h2>\\n<p>The new recommended solution is <a href=\\\"https://reactnavigation.org/\\\">React Navigation</a> which hopes to overcome the issues of the previous solutions. React Navigation is special because not only does it support iOS and Android, but it also works on the web. I moved from using Navigator to React Navigation and it is an incredible library. It is very flexible and removes the difficulties in managing tabs, navigation stacks and navigation draws. Unlike NavigationExperimental, it is easy to get started with (it took me 15 minutes to understand) and requires less logic since it’s done by the library. It also has support for deep linking.</p>\\n<p>Navigation in React Native has been a mess, but the developers in the community are doing a great job at finalising a long-term solution with React Navigation. I’ve been using it in my app for a few days and I’m pleased with its simplicity and performance. It’s currently in its 5th beta but seems stable. I look forward to seeing happens to the library in the future.</p>\\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> NavigatorIOS, Navigator and NavigationExperimental are all depreciated. The official and best solution to use is React Navigation.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/validating-forms-in-react-native\",\"date\":\"12th February 2017\",\"title\":\"Validating Forms in React Native\"},\"excerpt\":\"As I’m in the midst of building a React Native app for my exam studying tool,  Revisify , I needed to find an elegant solution to validating forms.

One of my favourite advantages of using React Native is that there are plenty of Javascript libraries already out there to help speed up your development, one of them being <a href=\\\"http://validatejs.org\\\">validate.js</a>, which helps you to… validate your forms!</p>\\n<h2>How Validate.js Works</h2>\\n<p>Validate.js requires you to have a variable to hold your field validation rules such as presence checks, length checks etc. You can also create async and custom validators. Here is a basic example of what your rules could look like.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> validation <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  email<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    presence<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'^Please enter an email address'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    email<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'^Please enter a valid email address'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n\\n  password<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    presence<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'^Please enter a password'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    length<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      minimum<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">5</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'^Your password must be at least 5 characters'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">default</span> validation\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The structure is pretty self-explanatory other than you may have noticed that for all the error messages, I put <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">^</code> before them. The reason for this is because for some reason when you validate a field and there is an error, the error message will return the field name and the error message together such as Password Your password must be at least 5 characters. It’s a bit odd as to why this happens but my regex solution removes the field name from the error message.</p>\\n<h2>My Wrapper to Validate Fields</h2>\\n<p>I created a wrapper since I found that I would reuse a lot of the code between different forms.

My strong passion for programming, improving education and helping others led to the release of my website, Revisify, a free to use study tool for students. After 2 years of maturing the website, I plan on delivering the same experience on mobile.</p>\\n<p>I want to document my process of building the Revisify app so that others who are building their first React Native app too will be able to refer to my process. If you’re interested in why I chose React Native over traditional development, <a href=\\\"https://blog.revisify.com/5-reasons-why-i-chose-react-native-over-traditional-app-development-3de18e208b8a#.m0wqbypjm\\\">I talk about it here</a> however in this post I will be showing you the libraries that I am using to build the Revisify app.</p>\\n<h2>Data management: Redux, Redux-Saga</h2>\\n<p>The most popular library for implementing the <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a> application architecture is currently <a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org/\\\">Redux</a> (If you don’t understand Flux and Redux you can <a href=\\\"https://blog.revisify.com/using-redux-with-react-native-9d07381507fe#.oku5fl6xp\\\">read about it here</a>). I started learning <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs\\\">Reflux</a> but moved over to Redux as the official documentation is excellent and the development of other libraries such as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs\\\">Reflux</a> is slowing down.</p>\\n<p>Redux does not have the functionality to pull data from an API so there are libraries to help you do that. I began using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk\\\">Redux-Thunk</a> since it was easier to understand than the alternative <a href=\\\"https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga\\\">Redux-Saga</a> however I switched over to using Sagas for multiple reasons. It was clear from starting to use Redux-Thunk that it would quickly become a mess to manage and test, especially since my app relies heavily on API calls. Redux-Saga has kept my code organised and easy to understand as well as made it simple to test. Unless your app barely relies on an API I would recommend taking the time to learn Sagas.</p>\\n<h2>Forms: Validate.js</h2>\\n<p>Most if not all apps have forms somewhere which is why it’s important to validate the inputted data. When looking around for a React Native solution I didn’t find anything. Thankfully one of the advantages of React Native is that apps are programmed in Javascript, meaning that there are already libraries that help you to do a load of stuff. One of those libraries is <a href=\\\"https://validatejs.org/\\\">validate.js</a> (it only takes up a tiny 4.56KB). Validate.js simply allows you to define validation rules and error messages to different fields in your form. I plan on writing a post in the future to outline my process of implementing it into a React Native app.</p>\\n<h2>Testing: Jest</h2>\\n<p>I really love <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/\\\">Jest</a> due to its simplicity and ease of understanding. Jest works by creating a ‘snapshot’ of your components. If you update the component and generate a new snapshot of it, Jest will compare the old and new versions and ask you if the changes are intended or not. Like React Native, Jest is also built my Facebook, so there is <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react-native.html#content\\\">good documentation</a> for implementing it into your app.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Something which I have learnt from building the Revisify website is that it is important to use the right tools and libraries when initially building your application since you’ll have to use it for a long time. If you want to make your development easier use the right tools at the beginning. Your future self will love you for it.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/using-redux-with-react-native\",\"date\":\"30th January 2017\",\"title\":\"Using Redux with React Native\"},\"excerpt\":\"I’m in the middle of developing a React Native app — Revisify.

Originally starting as a website to help students prepare for their exams, I’m currently moving the experience over to mobile. As this is my first React Native app, getting my head around new ideas has been challenging. The hardest thing for me since I started has been understanding Flux and Redux. Since React Native and Redux are fairly young (about 2 years old), there is not a lot of resources on the subject, so today I’ll give you my thoughts on implementing Redux into your application.</p>\\n<h3>What is Flux/Redux?</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a> is a pattern which Facebook created to manage the data of an application. Flux is <strong>not</strong> a library, it’s just an idea.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org\\\">Redux</a> is one of many Javascript libraries that help you create applications using the Flux architecture.</p>\\n<h3>Why should you use Flux in the first place?</h3>\\n<p>When learning about Redux, I didn’t understand why I should use it. To make it straightforward for you here’s a few reasons why you may want to use Redux:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>It makes managing data and understanding data flow in your application much easier since data can only be send one way (unidirectional) rather than being like a mess, like spaghetti.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Data that needs to be accessed in multiple parts of your application such as the user’s details can be stored easily in one place</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If your app is very basic, you probably don’t need Redux, it all depends on your app and it’s features. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you’ll be able to understand whether Redux is for you.</p>\\n<h3>How does Redux work?</h3>\\n<p>Redux has one big object that contains all the data you choose to store called the <strong>state</strong>. The state for a note taking app could look like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n user<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n   name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'John Smith'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n   age<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">22</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n   email<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'john_smith1@gmail.com'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n notes<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'remember to take the washing out'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'pick up some apples on the way home'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'give Jane a call'</span>\\n <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can see that there is information about the user using the app such as his name and also a list of notes that have been created. I like to think of the the state as a database.</p>\\n<p>One thing which confused me was the fact that Redux state and React components state were 2 different things, just with a different name. Remember the Redux state is a way to store data whereas a React component’s state has nothing to do with Redux and simply keeps track of data which can change within a component.</p>\\n<p>To manage the data in the Redux state, we have 3 things: actions, reducers and stores.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Actions</strong> can be sent when a user presses a button, load an app, etc. They can contain information that you want to add to the state.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Reducers</strong> listen for actions. When it hears that an action has been sent to it, it updates the state.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>The Store</strong> holds the Redux state and allows access and modifications to it. It’s the middleman between actions and reducers.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>To explain what each of these does, let’s pretend we have an app with a button and a counter. Every time the user presses the button, the counter goes up by one. So if we were to build this app using Redux here is how it would work.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The user presses the button, sending (or better known as ‘dispatching’) an action</li>\\n</ol>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">App</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\">render</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// this.props.count comes from the Redux state</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>Text<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>count<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>Text<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// This.props.addToCounter() is a function to update the counter</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>Button onPress<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">addToCounter</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n        Click Me<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>Button<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// This function provides a means of sending actions so that data in the Redux store</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// can be modified.

button has been pressed.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>It’s quite straightforward once you get the hang of it. One thing I did not mention was the store. The store is something you setup and not need to worry about after. Here is how you should implement it:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> reducer <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'./reducer'</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// This connects the reducer to the store</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">default</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">configureStore</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> store <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">createStore</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>reducer<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> store\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As I said before, the store ties together actions and reducers. When you send an action using <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">this.props.addToCounter()</code> you’re actually calling <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">dispatch(addToCounter())</code> (this is because we set this up in <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">mapDispatchToProps())</code>. The dispatch function comes from the store behind the scenes. The reducer is used when creating the store as you can see in the above code snippet.</p>\\n<p>The last thing you need to do now is include the store into your application:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> Component <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'react'</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> AppRegistry <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'react-native'</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> Provider <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'react-redux'</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> App <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'./app'</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> configureStore <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'./store.js'</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> store <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">configureStore</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">MyCounterApp</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\">render</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// &lt;Provider> allows us to access the store for dispatching actions and receiving data from</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// the state in it's children i.e. &lt;App/></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>Provider store<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>store<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>App <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>Provider<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\nAppRegistry<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">registerComponent</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'MyCounterApp'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> MyCounterApp<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>And there you have it!

Revisify has matured on the web for 2 years now and I’m in the process of building an iOS and Android app. I’m a complete newbie to app development, I only started in August 2016. After some research, I found that I had 2 options to build the app:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Native development i.e. Swift/Objective-C and Java</li>\\n<li>Hybrid development i.e. React Native, Ionic, Xamarin etc.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I decided to learn the ways of Swift and Xcode by reading the book <a href=\\\"http://amzn.eu/1SjzQhK\\\">iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a> and going through tutorials online. I liked Swift and spent 8 weeks straight learning iOS development before discovering Facebook’s framework for building apps and I quickly realised that React Native was better suited to my needs. Let me explain why.</p>\\n<h2>I can share most of the code for both iOS and Android apps</h2>\\n<p>This is the biggest advantage React Native has over traditional app development. All the code is written in Javascript which means that developers no longer have to learn Swift/Objective-C and Java as well as different concepts for each mobile platform. We don’t have to write our code twice! For small businesses like me (I’m the only person working on the app at the moment) this is a huge timesaver. This allows me to spend more time working on what matters most — improving my app and in turn bettering the user’s experience.</p>\\n<h2>React Native Apps are… Native</h2>\\n<p>There are different frameworks like <a href=\\\"https://www.ionicframwork.com\\\">Ionic</a> and <a href=\\\"https://ionicframework.com\\\">Xamarin</a> which provide a means of writing code once and deploying it to Android and iOS. In hopes of finding the best framework, I researched the pros and cons of each solution.</p>\\n<p>Ionic, unlike React Native, renders a web view rather than native code. This means that Ionic apps don’t have that ‘native’ feel to them, meaning they feel more like a web browser than an app. While this would make developing the app easier since I could just use a majority of the code from my website in the app, it wouldn’t provide the ‘app’ experience which many users are accustomed to.</p>\\n<p>Xamarin, on the other hand, uses C# to build apps that are native, just like React Native. As I’m originally a web developer, I felt more comfortable to use React Native over Xamarin. I already knew that the community for Javascript was huge and I understand the language very well. I’m sure if I were to have had a .NET development background I would have chosen Xamarin.</p>\\n<h2>The community is already very large</h2>\\n<p>While React Native is (at the time of writing this post) almost 2 years old, the support is incredible. There are currently 17,188 repositories when I search for ‘react native’ on GitHub and 10,012 questions tagged with ‘react-native’ on Stack Overflow. Just to think how new this framework is, there are already plenty of people who are working on or using React Native. As I’m building my app now, I’ve found that there are lots of libraries that have helped me to add a certain feature or to simplify my development process. The only downside is that support for the latest features in iOS and Android will take longer to work with React Native since libraries must be developed to do so. However, as the community expands further, I’m sure this delay will become much shorter.</p>\\n<h2>You can (sometimes) bypass slow App Store update approvals</h2>\\n<p>One thing that makes me nervous is the thought of pushing updates to my app and realising that there is a bug, then pushing a new update that takes around 5 to 10 days to fix it. I’m sure that vigorous testing before sending the app out to users would reduce the number of bugs, however sometimes bugs do get missed. Thankfully Microsoft created a tool, <a href=\\\"https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/\\\">CodePush</a>, that can send updates to the Javascript portion of the app instantly. While Apple is understandably a bit funny about this (they only allow you to do this if your update does not change the functionality of your app) the option to do this is very nice.</p>\\n<h2>It’s a beautiful framework and it’s easy to learn</h2>\\n<p>As I’m a web developer, I found myself right at home with React Native. If you have never used React on the web before like me, then it takes a little to adjust, but the learning curve is surprisingly minimal. React has a focus on creating reusable components like buttons, text inputs and images which makes development easy as everything is modular.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Honestly, React Native is fantastic, there are some downsides to it compared to traditional native apps, but for my needs, its advantages far outweigh its disadvantages. I genuinely believe that this is the future of app development and I’m excited to be using it for my app.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/the-timezone-struggle\",\"date\":\"27th December 2016\",\"title\":\"The Timezone Struggle\"},\"excerpt\":\"Something I recently found difficult to get my head around was how timezones work.

I’ve stored all the dates/times a student has tested themselves in a database, now all I need to do is get today’s date, and work backwards through the database, check if yesterday’s date is there and if so, check the previous day’s date and continue on until one of the dates is not available. However, something which I forgot about was that this would not work for students who live in a timezone other than GMT. Why? Because the server is based in the UK. The way I programmed the server is that every time a student tests themselves, the server will get the server’s date/time and logs it into the database.</p>\\n<h2>Coordinated Universal Time</h2>\\n<p>I found out that there is something called *Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) *time. Don’t ask me why it isn’t shortened down to UTC instead of CUT, <a href=\\\"https://www.timeanddate.com/time/utc-abbreviation.html\\\">you can read why here.</a> UTC is basically a global standard for timezones and it has the exact same time as GMT.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>The time in the UK as represented in UTC would simply be UTC+00:00, because as I said, UTC time is the same as GMT.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>If we wanted the time in Australia, it would be represented as UTC+09:30 as it is 9 hours and 30 minutes ahead of the time in the UK.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The time in Hawaii would be UTC-10:00 as it is 10 hours behind of the time in the UK.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Dealing with UTC Server</h2>\\n<p>Okay so back to Revisify. By knowing this, if we stored the date/time in UTC+00:00, we could then convert that to the local time of the student is located. Luckily since I only have 1 server which happens to be based in the UK, the dates in the database are already in UTC+00:00. However, I still needed to change some Python code on the server:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-python\\\"><code class=\\\"language-python\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> datetime <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> datetime\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># This gets the server time. If I moved the server to say Australia, it would not get UTC time.</span>\\ndate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> datetime<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>now<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># This gets UTC time regardless of where the server is located.</span>\\ndate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> datetime<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>utcnow<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2>Dealing with UTC Client Side</h2>\\n<p>Now that I ‘officially’ store UTC dates/times in the database, I need to convert these correctly to the student’s local time. This can be difficult to program yourself but luckily there’s a fantastic Javascript Library called <a href=\\\"http://momentjs.com/\\\">Moment.js</a> which takes out **a lot **of the strain of converting timezones. Here’s how easy it was for me to convert the UTC date/times that I got from the database into the local time of the student’s computer:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Server's UTC datetime</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> utcDate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'2016-12-20 14:56:51'</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Client's local datetime</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> localDate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> moment<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">utc</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>utcDate<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">local</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>That simple line of code is all that is needed for the client to get the right date. This library has a lot more functions but I will leave that for another time.</p>\\n<p>Back to the study streak, I updated the code so that the server sends the dates and some Javascript on the client side calculates the study streak. The final result is <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/PavSidhu/8a3b04bc7f16ba6a2eb38f6803254fda\\\">available here</a> with some annotations as to how it works.

I was really worried because I had been putting off looking for an internship over Summer. I wanted to get some experience during my break, so I set out on an intense plan to find a placement.</p>\\n<p>In this post, I’ll outline the steps that I went through to find a company that would offer me a placement. Hopefully, you can take these steps to help you with your own internship search.</p>\\n<h2>1. Research potential placements</h2>\\n<p>After my exams, I spent several days straight researching potential places to work.</p>\\n<p>The majority of smaller companies will not outright ask for interns. As a result, it’s important to know that <strong>you</strong> need to put in the effort to get in contact with companies.</p>\\n<p>I used job websites like indeed.com and LinkedIn to look for normal jobs that have a similar area of experience that I have or want to expand on.</p>\\n<p>As a data nerd, I made a spreadsheet of companies that I could work for. Even if I didn’t want to work at a particular place I’d put it in the spreadsheet for completion.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 53.99543378995434%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"A preview of my spreadsheet\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-1eceb.png 1050w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-f5de9.png 1400w,\\n/static/spreadsheet-36570eb2cd1f842f372cb417ac9cf67f-704c7.png 1752w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>A preview of part of my spreadsheet</em></p>\\n<p>I ended up having a list of over 10 companies. The more places you ask the higher your chance of getting a response. Quantity is important, especially if you live in an area like me where there are not that many tech opportunities available.</p>\\n<h2>2. Reaching out</h2>\\n<p>After making my spreadsheet, the next step was to contact all of the companies that interest you.</p>\\n<p>While you could phone a company, email is much preferred. This will give you time to plan what you want to say as best as you can. It also lets whoever receives the email to reply back when they get the time.</p>\\n<p>Since a lot of emails are of the same format, I found it would be easier to build an email template. My template contained information including who I was, why I was contacting them and what I could do for them.</p>\\n<p>Now here is the most important part. Rather than sending the same email to each company talking about why you’re so great (I’m sure you are), don’t forget that there’s a person on the other side of the email. People can spot the difference between a spam email and a genuine one. That’s why it’s important to tailor your email and make it as custom to the company as possible. This involves being honest and saying why you like the company, why you would be a good fit and what you could offer them.</p>\\n<p>If you want an idea of what you can write, here is the email template I used:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>\\n<p>My name is Pav Sidhu from Cardiff. I am currently an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham. I finish university at the end of June and I am looking for an internship opportunity over Summer.</p>\\n<p>(Insert why I like the company, why I would be a good fit and what you could do for them.)</p>\\n<p>I have several years of web development experience which I have outlined on the attached CV however to outline my technological skills:</p>\\n<p>Front-end: HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript (ES6, React, jQuery, AJAX)\\nBack-end: Node.js, Python, Java, SQL, GraphQL</p>\\n<p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this, I would love to spend 15 minutes or so to discuss such an opportunity.</p>\\n<p>Regards,</p>\\n<p>Pav Sidhu</p>\\n<p>Phone: +01 2345 67890</p>\\n<p>Website: <a href=\\\"https://pavsidhu.com/\\\">https://pavsidhu.com</a></p>\\n<p>Blog: <a href=\\\"https://blog.pavsidhu.com/\\\">https://blog.pavsidhu.com</a></p>\\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\\\"https://github.com/pavsidhu\\\">https://github.com/pavsidhu</a></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Remember to keep your email short and sweet, the person reading this doesn’t want to hear about all your achievements, no matter how great they are.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, proofread your emails. I used <a href=\\\"grammarly.com\\\">Grammarly</a> to check for grammar errors and <a href=\\\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\\\">Hemingway editor</a> to ensure my writing was clear.</p>\\n<p>Don’t forget to attach your CV so if a company is interested they read more about your skills in more detail. I can’t tell you how many times I almost forgot to attach mine 😅.</p>\\n<p>I sent my emails on Sunday night. This means that on Monday morning, the first thing they see will be your email. Unless you have to, try not to send it on any other day. Even if you may have been a great fit they wouldn’t know because they might miss your email!</p>\\n<h2>3. Waiting for a response</h2>\\n<p>The first thing to note is that a potential intern is not a companies number one priority so don’t always expect a reply back any time soon. To be safe I would wait a week or two for a response. If you don’t receive anything, send a polite email asking if they received your email.</p>\\n<p>Not all companies have the time to respond so only a few, if any, will reply.</p>\\n<p>If you have gotten a response, you will likely send a few emails back and forth to discuss a potential phone call or meeting to see if you are a good fit.</p>\\n<p>I was lucky when getting my internship. I was called into the office to have a chat to see what I could do for the company and what I could get out of it. Small companies are less predictable, so some companies may have an interview process while others may not.</p>\\n<p>If everything works out you’ve got yourself an internship, congrats! 🎉🎉🎉</p>\\n<h2>4. One Last Controversial Point</h2>\\n<p>Working for free is not something that everybody agrees on. I believe that you shouldn’t feel entitled to be paid a salary if you have little to no experience.</p>\\n<p>If you can afford it and you enjoy what you’re doing, you should be happy working for free. The company is doing you a favour by taking a risk and giving you experience.</p>\\n<p>As a student, I know the importance of money however it doesn’t get easier when you’re older with a mortgage and bills. Take the opportunity now to get experience while you can, it’ll help you out in the long run.</p>\\n<p>If you or the company you work for thinks you are doing a good job, you could discuss potential pay with them.</p>\\n<h2>Some Final Tips</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Although I procrastinated and left my search till late, start your search early. You will have a greater chance of getting an internship, especially if you’re going for bigger companies, though that’s a different game altogether.</li>\\n<li>If you can do your work without much support from others, startups are more likely to take you on. As startups are usually growing at a rapid pace, they need all the help they can get. If you have the skills they will be keen to have you join their team.</li>\\n<li>Be polite, remember that someone is taking time out of their busy work schedule to help you.</li>\\n<li>Getting an internship is hard, my internship success came with a mix of hard work and luck. If a company ignores or rejects you, don’t feel discouraged its part of the process.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Good luck with your search! I would love to hear if you manage to get an internship.

The only thing I would bring into my projects would be jQuery or if I was feeling extra fancy I would use Sass.</p>\\n<p>Nowadays, we have tools like Gatsby and Netlify which greatly improve the experience of building static websites. Rather than thinking about boilerplate and configuration (looking at you Webpack) you can just focus on your application.</p>\\n<p>I wouldn’t hesitate to say that the Gatsby and Netlify flow is the best programming experience I’ve ever had. Let me explain why.</p>\\n<h2>Gatsby</h2>\\n<p>Gatsby is a static site generator that uses React. Everything is configured out of the box including React, Webpack, Prettier and more.</p>\\n<p>Since Gatsby builds on top of React, you get all the benefits of React such as its performance, components, JSX, React library ecosystem and a large community (React is nearing 100,000 stars on GitHub 😱).</p>\\n<p>If you haven’t used React before there is a learning curve but there are plenty of well written tutorials that makes learning React very accessible. Not to mention the <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/\\\">official React documentation</a> is very well written.</p>\\n<p>For many static websites like my blog, I need to use external data sources (my actual blog posts) during the build process. Gatsby provides support for many forms of data, including Markdown, APIs, Databases and CMSs like WordPress. To access this data, Gatsby uses GraphQL.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 87.20930232558139%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Gatsby flow\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/gatsby_flow-478978f41307ca0c85f80e04f67ddc55-23179.png 860w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>Taken straight from the Gatsby website</em></p>\\n<p>All my blog posts are in Markdown, so I’m using a Gatsby plugin <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/?=gatsby-transformer-remark\\\">gatsby-transformer-remark</a> that allows you to query your Markdown files using GraphQL.

If GraphQL is new to you, it does add yet another thing to learn, however, the documentation on using GraphQL with Gatsby has plenty of information and code snippets that you can use.</p>\\n<p>If you are building a simple blog like mine and there are only one or two queries you need to make, there are Gatsby starter kits that already set up gatsby-transformer-remark and all the querying for you. To speed up development I used one called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/noahg/gatsby-starter-blog-no-styles/\\\">gatsby-starter-blog-no-styles</a>.</p>\\n<p>I am a huge fan of styled-components so I used it when building this blog. I did encounter an issue with styling my blog posts since there was no way to specify to gatsby-transformer-remark how to style your components. Instead I had to use plain CSS for styling. I would love to see something like the following in <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">gatsby-config.js</code>:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> styled <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'styled-components'</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> Header <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> styled<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>h1<span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`\\n  font-size: 24px;\\n  color: #333333;\\n`</span></span>\\n\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  plugins<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'gatsby-transformer-remark'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      options<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> Header<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Aside from the actual usage of Gatsby, the <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/\\\">official documentation</a> is very well written and up to date. Each guide in the docs explain concepts of Gatsby so well, it’s likely that in most cases you won’t need to check any third party source of information.</p>\\n<p>The only difficulty I came across when using Gatbsy was when I deployed my website I had a FOUC (flash of unstyled content). To fix this issue I found that upgrading Gatsby from 1.8.12 to 1.9.250 fixed the issue. I’m not too sure why this fixed it, I assume it must have been an internal issue with Gatsby.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 62.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"fouc.png\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-e3b29.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-6572b.png 175w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-e1ddf.png 350w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-e3b29.png 700w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-1eceb.png 1050w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-f5de9.png 1400w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-a1d38.png 2100w,\\n/static/fouc-8a47d779886cc744413760239aae8fa1-b65a5.png 2880w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  <em>I mean who really wants to see my forehead?</em></p>\\n<h2>Netlify</h2>\\n<p>Usually, when building a static website, I’ll use GitHub pages because it’s free and fairly easy to set up. Although I still think GitHub pages is a great tool, Netlify takes the process one step further to make the developer experience even more efficient.</p>\\n<p>Once you’ve <a href=\\\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/\\\">hooked up Netlify to your repo</a>, each push to your GitHub repository, automatically builds your website, according to the static site generator you’re using, and deploys it to production.</p>\\n<p>Although I currently only use Netlify for static site hosting, it supports cloud functions, domain management (with SSL), form submissions, a/b testing and more.</p>\\n<p>Besides features, Netlify’s web interface is clean and easy to use. Coming from using AWS a lot in past projects, the difference is night and day. While AWS has it’s advantages being highly configurable, the large portion of us developers are unlikely to use this functionality. When I first used S3 or Lambda (Amazon’s static file and cloud function services) I would spend a considerable amount of time looking up Amazon’s difficult and sometimes out of date documentation. There is a whole lot of unneeded complexity and Amazon jargon when using AWS which is why Netlify is a breath of fresh air. It’s one of those services that <em>just</em> works.</p>\\n<p>The best part about Netlify is that it’s free. If you’re in a large team or need more resources for cloud functions, form submissions and more they do have paid options. If you plan on building a small blog like me, it’s unlikely you’ll need to pay for anything.</p>\\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\\n<p>Gatsby and Netlify are the easiest way to build and publish a static website. Period.</p>\\n<p>If you would like an example of how to build a blog using Gatsby, the code for my blog is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/pavsidhu/blog\\\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/docker-an-explanation-for-beginners\",\"date\":\"12th August 2017\",\"title\":\"🐳 Docker: An Explanation for Beginners\"},\"excerpt\":\"During the 6 years I’ve been programming, I’ve discovered a pattern when learning something new.

At first what you’re learning feels impossible to understand. It isn’t until afterwards, you realise it wasn’t actually that difficult all along. Docker is no exception of this pattern.</p>\\n<p>In this post, I aim to answer all the questions I had when first learning Docker. Please note that this isn’t a technical tutorial as such, it’s an explanation of the world of Docker. If it’s a tutorial that you’re after I’ve linked a couple of my favourites at the end of this article.</p>\\n<h2>What’s the problem that Docker aims to solve?</h2>\\n<p>While Docker solves a lot of things, its main selling point is that it improves consistency.</p>\\n<p>When a group of people are working on the same application, there can be inconsistencies with operating systems and setups. This can lead to a bunch of different issues.</p>\\n<p>There may even be inconsistencies when running your application on your own computer and on your production server.</p>\\n<p>All these issues take you away from solving the actual problem, which is building your application.</p>\\n<h2>So, how does Docker solve this?</h2>\\n<p>Docker has a thing they call containers. They are like Linux virtual machines but they are very efficient and use fewer resources. Your application can be run inside its own isolated container with a consistent environment.</p>\\n<p>A container which includes your application can be run on Windows, MacOS or Linux. This removes any of the quirks that come with developers having different operating systems and setups on their computer.</p>\\n<p>Docker’s ability to keep a consistent environment makes your application very portable.</p>\\n<h2>But where do I get these containers?</h2>\\n<p>Docker has a place where you are able to download containers called Docker Hub.</p>\\n<p>While you can create your own container from scratch the likelihood of you needing to is low. By downloading a container which already has already been setup, you can start building your application sooner.</p>\\n<p>A few examples of containers that you can download from Docker Hub include <a href=\\\"https://hub.docker.com/_/node/\\\">Node.js</a>, <a href=\\\"https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/\\\">MySQL</a> or even <a href=\\\"https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/\\\">Ubuntu</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I add my app to the container?</h2>\\n<p>Once you’ve found the container that you want, you’ll want to be able to customise it to add your application, setup dependencies and more. This is where a Dockerfile comes in.</p>\\n<p>A Dockerfile, in short, explains how you want Docker to set up your container when it first loads. This is how a basic Dockerfile for a Node.js application might look like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\"># Use the official Node.js runtime as a base image\\nFROM node:alpine\\n\\n# Set the directory of my web application to /app\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy over my project’s directory into the container /app folder\\nAdd . /app\\n\\n# Install all the dependencies for my web application\\nRUN yarn install\\n\\n# Make the port 3000 accessible outside of Docker\\nEXPOSE 3000\\n\\n# Execute the command yarn start\\nCMD [&quot;yarn&quot;, &quot;start&quot;]</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This Dockerfile will now run whenever an instance of the container is being built. Yet to create a container you need to create a Docker image. Once you create the image, you can use it to create as many containers as you wish.</p>\\n<h2>So I need only a single container for my whole app?</h2>\\n<p>While you can do this, it’s best practice to isolate parts of your application into different containers.</p>\\n<p>For example, a web application that requires a Python web server and a database should have two containers rather than one. The first should be for your Python server and the second for your database.</p>\\n<p>Why? It makes your application more modular. If your application grows in the future or has random spikes in traffic, you can spin up several Python server instances to share the load.</p>\\n<h2>Can’t it get difficult managing different containers at the same time?</h2>\\n<p>Yup. That’s why Docker created another tool called Docker Compose. It allows you to specify the configuration of Docker containers that rely on each other in one file. A Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) may look something like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">version: &#39;2&#39;\\nservices:\\n  server:\\n    build: .\\n    ports:\\n      - &quot;3000:3000&quot;\\n    volumes:\\n      - .:/app\\n  database:\\n    image: &quot;mariadb:10.3&quot;\\n    environment:\\n      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=MyPassword\\n      - MYSQL_DATABASE=MyDatabase\\n    ports:\\n      - &quot;3306:3306&quot;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As you might see, we’ve created two services (or containers), one named server and another named database. I’ve specified the ports, environment variables and other information.</p>\\n<p>Once you’ve set up the docker-compose.yml file it becomes easier to manage a group of containers for a single application.</p>\\n<h2>What else is there that I should know?</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Kitematic:</strong> This is a program that allows you to manage containers through a visual interface. I would recommend you use this in the beginning since setting up containers in the command line can be overwhelming.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Docker Swarm:</strong> When your application grows, you might want to have several containers that handle your traffic. Docker Swarm makes it easier to manage groups of containers (called clusters) at a time. This is something you should consider implementing in the future.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<p>Here are a couple of the resources that I found useful when learning Docker myself:</p>\\n<p>The Docker docs of course, though I found them to be intimidating for beginners. <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/get-started\\\">Get Started, Part 1: Orientation and setup</a></p>\\n<p>DigitalOcean has some brilliant resources.

This was quite a scary thought at first but after researching and going back and forth between closed source and open source, I ended up going for the latter. Here are 5 reasons why I will open source my app.</p>\\n<h2>1. Give back to the community</h2>\\n<p>When developers tell you that they were ‘self-taught’, they are most definitely wrong. Self-taught developers have been trained by the millions of people that have written blog posts, created videos, build documentation and open sourced their code.</p>\\n<p>These people have given so much value to you, they have spent countless hours building stuff to support your progression as a developer so you should do the same.</p>\\n<p>Yes, open sourcing your project will take a small amount of your time but the advantages that it has on others (and you) far outweigh this issue.</p>\\n<h2>2. Build better code</h2>\\n<p>When open sourcing an app, you need to make sure that your code is understandable by other developers. This means that you must write clear code and simple documentation.</p>\\n<p>Especially for those like me who are building a project alone, it’s easy to skip documentation since you know what you’ve built and have forgotten the learning curve required if another developer decided to join your project. Even in a team, developers may regard something as being common sense when someone new may not have a clue.</p>\\n<p>When you open up your project for other developers to peer into, it forces you to think differently. <em>Is this code easy to understand? Should my documentation be clearer? How can this be made simpler?</em></p>\\n<p>I think some developers (myself included) can become lazy with building readable code. This mindset shift when you realise that someone you’ve never met should be able to understand your code is a drastic advantage to building maintainable and sustainable code.</p>\\n<h2>3. Nobody can steal your business</h2>\\n<p>One of the reasons why I considered not to open source my app was because I worried that someone could take my code and ‘copy’ my idea.</p>\\n<p>Since developers spend lots of time and effort into their projects, there is a fear that someone will steal your hard work if you were to open source. I came to a sudden realisation that it doesn’t matter.</p>\\n<p><strong>There’s more to a business than just code, the community you build is something which others simply can’t copy.</strong></p>\\n<p>It can be difficult when you have lots of pride in your work but spending the time to build your following and interact with your community will ensure that you have something which no other business can emulate.</p>\\n<p>If you’re worried that a competitor will copy your idea, then remember that they can still copy your idea if your code isn’t available to them. Even so, it doesn’t make it easier when you code is open sourced since they have to remodel your idea to work with their project.</p>\\n<h2>4. Free tools!</h2>\\n<p>Some businesses in the development space like to give back to the open source community, so they give away their tools for free.</p>\\n<p>The biggest of these tools is clearly <a href=\\\"https://github.com/\\\">GitHub</a>. It’s solid platform and 14 million users (as of April 2016) shows that it’s the best place to host your project.</p>\\n<p>Another popular tool is <a href=\\\"https://travis-ci.org/\\\">Travis CI</a> which makes testing your project straightforward. Almost every project I see on GitHub uses Travis CI. Its setup is incredibly simple and is hosted for you for free if your project is open source.</p>\\n<p>One last tool is <a href=\\\"https://canny.io/\\\">Canny</a> (it used to be called Product Pains) which helps you to interact with your community and discover areas in your project that can be improved. The only downside to using this tool is that they only allow you to go for their open source plan if you aren’t a product, meaning that your project should be for helping the development community.</p>\\n<p>There are several other tools which are free if you are open source, I recommend you research what tools you need and check if there is a free open source solution.</p>\\n<h2>5. Learn from your community</h2>\\n<p>When working on a project in isolation, you’re limited to your ideas and knowledge. This can be a hindrance to your business, which is why more companies are listening to their communities by open sourcing their products. Companies like Facebook and Google are at the forefront of open source but even non-tech companies are doing this. If this isn’t a sign that open source is here <strong>now</strong>, then I don’t know what will be.</p>\\n<p>By releasing your code to the public, you show that you care. While the community for my project isn’t necessarily developers, there are developers who care about the same issues as you do. Their ideas can help shape your product for the better and improve your business.</p>\\n<p>While open source is difficult in the short term, it’s the benefits in the long term that will make your efforts worthwhile.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/whats-happening-with-navigation-in-react-native\",\"date\":\"19th February 2017\",\"title\":\"What’s Happening with Navigation in React Native?\"},\"excerpt\":\"When I began learning React Native the docs and developers said that to handle navigation between scenes in your app you should use  Navigator  and a depreciated component,  NavigatorIOS , was no longer recommended. After I began using…\",\"html\":\"<p>When I began learning React Native the docs and developers said that to handle navigation between scenes in your app you should use <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html\\\">Navigator</a> and a depreciated component, <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigatorios.html\\\">NavigatorIOS</a>, was no longer recommended. After I began using Navigator, I found out about another component, <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html#navigationexperimental\\\">NavigationExperimental</a>, which was being developed to replace Navigator. After seeing a <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/5ufr1h/why_is_navigation_in_react_native_such_a_big_mess/\\\">post</a> on the React Native subreddit and then doing some digging, I found out that Navigator and NavigationExperimental will be depreciated in favour of one last library <a href=\\\"https://reactnavigation.org/\\\">React-Navigation</a>. It’s all a bit of a mess but I will clear everything up from what I’ve found while building my app.</p>\\n<h2>NavigatorIOS</h2>\\n<p>The first solution to navigation in React Native was NavigatorIOS. As the name suggests, it only works on iOS, since it was built before React Native supported Android. While it uses the native navigation bar in iOS, NavigatorIOS has multiple bugs which have not been fixed and the lack of customisation of the appearance of the navigation bar can be difficult to style the app the way you would like. I can’t imagine anyone wanting to use this for a new project.</p>\\n<h2>Navigator</h2>\\n<p>Navigator was built to replace NavigatorIOS. Since it isn’t native and uses Javascript, it is supported on iOS and Android. It is more customisable than NavigatorIOS, but animations are slower since it isn’t native. <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/using-navigators.html\\\">The docs still use Navigator</a> to introduce new developers to React Native however, it is being depreciated, so if you plan on building an app or have just begun, it isn’t recommended.</p>\\n<h2>NavigationExperimental</h2>\\n<p>NavigationExperimental was developed to add several improvements the Navigator. Since using Navigator can lead to code being messy and difficult to understand, NavigationExperimental uses single directional data flow to navigate through scenes (basically it supports <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a>). It also keeps the navigation code separate from the view logic. The only issue with NavigationExperimental is that while you get more control, the setup and usage is a bit more difficult. Like NavigatorIOS and Navigator, NavigationExperimental is being <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Roadmap\\\">depreciated</a>.</p>\\n<h2>React Navigation</h2>\\n<p>The new recommended solution is <a href=\\\"https://reactnavigation.org/\\\">React Navigation</a> which hopes to overcome the issues of the previous solutions. React Navigation is special because not only does it support iOS and Android, but it also works on the web. I moved from using Navigator to React Navigation and it is an incredible library. It is very flexible and removes the difficulties in managing tabs, navigation stacks and navigation draws. Unlike NavigationExperimental, it is easy to get started with (it took me 15 minutes to understand) and requires less logic since it’s done by the library. It also has support for deep linking.</p>\\n<p>Navigation in React Native has been a mess, but the developers in the community are doing a great job at finalising a long-term solution with React Navigation. I’ve been using it in my app for a few days and I’m pleased with its simplicity and performance. It’s currently in its 5th beta but seems stable. I look forward to seeing happens to the library in the future.</p>\\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> NavigatorIOS, Navigator and NavigationExperimental are all depreciated. The official and best solution to use is React Navigation.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/validating-forms-in-react-native\",\"date\":\"12th February 2017\",\"title\":\"Validating Forms in React Native\"},\"excerpt\":\"As I’m in the midst of building a React Native app for my exam studying tool,  Revisify , I needed to find an elegant solution to validating forms.

One of my favourite advantages of using React Native is that there are plenty of Javascript libraries already out there to help speed up your development, one of them being <a href=\\\"http://validatejs.org\\\">validate.js</a>, which helps you to… validate your forms!</p>\\n<h2>How Validate.js Works</h2>\\n<p>Validate.js requires you to have a variable to hold your field validation rules such as presence checks, length checks etc. You can also create async and custom validators. Here is a basic example of what your rules could look like.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> validation <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  email<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    presence<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'^Please enter an email address'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    email<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'^Please enter a valid email address'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n\\n  password<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    presence<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'^Please enter a password'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    length<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      minimum<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">5</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'^Your password must be at least 5 characters'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">default</span> validation\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The structure is pretty self-explanatory other than you may have noticed that for all the error messages, I put <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">^</code> before them. The reason for this is because for some reason when you validate a field and there is an error, the error message will return the field name and the error message together such as Password Your password must be at least 5 characters. It’s a bit odd as to why this happens but my regex solution removes the field name from the error message.</p>\\n<h2>My Wrapper to Validate Fields</h2>\\n<p>I created a wrapper since I found that I would reuse a lot of the code between different forms. The function below takes the field name and its value and return the error message if there is one.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> validation <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'validation.js'</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">default</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">validate</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>fieldName<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> value<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Validate.js validates your values as an object</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// e.g. var form = {email: 'email@example.com'}</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Line 8-9 creates an object based on the field name and field value</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> formValues <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n  formValues<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>fieldName<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> value\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Line 13-14 creates an temporary form with the validation fields</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// e.g. var formFields = {</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">//                        email: {</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">//                         presence: {</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">//                          message: 'Email is blank'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">//                         }</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">//                       }</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> formFields <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n  formFields<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>fieldName<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> validation<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>field<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// The formValues and validated against the formFields</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// the variable result hold the error messages of the field</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> result <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">validatejs</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>formValues<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> formFields<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// If there is an error message, return it!</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>result<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Return only the field error message if there are multiple</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> result<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>field<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">null</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2>My Custom TextInput Component</h2>\\n<p>Since I want every single TextInput to have validation, it would make sense to create a custom component which contained a TextInput and an error message.

My strong passion for programming, improving education and helping others led to the release of my website, Revisify, a free to use study tool for students. After 2 years of maturing the website, I plan on delivering the same experience on mobile.</p>\\n<p>I want to document my process of building the Revisify app so that others who are building their first React Native app too will be able to refer to my process. If you’re interested in why I chose React Native over traditional development, <a href=\\\"https://blog.revisify.com/5-reasons-why-i-chose-react-native-over-traditional-app-development-3de18e208b8a#.m0wqbypjm\\\">I talk about it here</a> however in this post I will be showing you the libraries that I am using to build the Revisify app.</p>\\n<h2>Data management: Redux, Redux-Saga</h2>\\n<p>The most popular library for implementing the <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a> application architecture is currently <a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org/\\\">Redux</a> (If you don’t understand Flux and Redux you can <a href=\\\"https://blog.revisify.com/using-redux-with-react-native-9d07381507fe#.oku5fl6xp\\\">read about it here</a>). I started learning <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs\\\">Reflux</a> but moved over to Redux as the official documentation is excellent and the development of other libraries such as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs\\\">Reflux</a> is slowing down.</p>\\n<p>Redux does not have the functionality to pull data from an API so there are libraries to help you do that. I began using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk\\\">Redux-Thunk</a> since it was easier to understand than the alternative <a href=\\\"https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga\\\">Redux-Saga</a> however I switched over to using Sagas for multiple reasons. It was clear from starting to use Redux-Thunk that it would quickly become a mess to manage and test, especially since my app relies heavily on API calls. Redux-Saga has kept my code organised and easy to understand as well as made it simple to test. Unless your app barely relies on an API I would recommend taking the time to learn Sagas.</p>\\n<h2>Forms: Validate.js</h2>\\n<p>Most if not all apps have forms somewhere which is why it’s important to validate the inputted data. When looking around for a React Native solution I didn’t find anything. Thankfully one of the advantages of React Native is that apps are programmed in Javascript, meaning that there are already libraries that help you to do a load of stuff. One of those libraries is <a href=\\\"https://validatejs.org/\\\">validate.js</a> (it only takes up a tiny 4.56KB). Validate.js simply allows you to define validation rules and error messages to different fields in your form. I plan on writing a post in the future to outline my process of implementing it into a React Native app.</p>\\n<h2>Testing: Jest</h2>\\n<p>I really love <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/\\\">Jest</a> due to its simplicity and ease of understanding. Jest works by creating a ‘snapshot’ of your components. If you update the component and generate a new snapshot of it, Jest will compare the old and new versions and ask you if the changes are intended or not. Like React Native, Jest is also built my Facebook, so there is <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react-native.html#content\\\">good documentation</a> for implementing it into your app.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Something which I have learnt from building the Revisify website is that it is important to use the right tools and libraries when initially building your application since you’ll have to use it for a long time. If you want to make your development easier use the right tools at the beginning. Your future self will love you for it.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/using-redux-with-react-native\",\"date\":\"30th January 2017\",\"title\":\"Using Redux with React Native\"},\"excerpt\":\"I’m in the middle of developing a React Native app — Revisify.

Originally starting as a website to help students prepare for their exams, I’m currently moving the experience over to mobile. As this is my first React Native app, getting my head around new ideas has been challenging. The hardest thing for me since I started has been understanding Flux and Redux. Since React Native and Redux are fairly young (about 2 years old), there is not a lot of resources on the subject, so today I’ll give you my thoughts on implementing Redux into your application.</p>\\n<h3>What is Flux/Redux?</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a> is a pattern which Facebook created to manage the data of an application. Flux is <strong>not</strong> a library, it’s just an idea.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org\\\">Redux</a> is one of many Javascript libraries that help you create applications using the Flux architecture.</p>\\n<h3>Why should you use Flux in the first place?</h3>\\n<p>When learning about Redux, I didn’t understand why I should use it. To make it straightforward for you here’s a few reasons why you may want to use Redux:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>It makes managing data and understanding data flow in your application much easier since data can only be send one way (unidirectional) rather than being like a mess, like spaghetti.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Data that needs to be accessed in multiple parts of your application such as the user’s details can be stored easily in one place</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If your app is very basic, you probably don’t need Redux, it all depends on your app and it’s features. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you’ll be able to understand whether Redux is for you.</p>\\n<h3>How does Redux work?</h3>\\n<p>Redux has one big object that contains all the data you choose to store called the <strong>state</strong>. The state for a note taking app could look like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n user<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n   name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'John Smith'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n   age<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">22</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n   email<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'john_smith1@gmail.com'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n notes<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'remember to take the washing out'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'pick up some apples on the way home'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n   <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'give Jane a call'</span>\\n <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can see that there is information about the user using the app such as his name and also a list of notes that have been created. I like to think of the the state as a database.</p>\\n<p>One thing which confused me was the fact that Redux state and React components state were 2 different things, just with a different name. Remember the Redux state is a way to store data whereas a React component’s state has nothing to do with Redux and simply keeps track of data which can change within a component.</p>\\n<p>To manage the data in the Redux state, we have 3 things: actions, reducers and stores.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Actions</strong> can be sent when a user presses a button, load an app, etc. They can contain information that you want to add to the state.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Reducers</strong> listen for actions. When it hears that an action has been sent to it, it updates the state.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>The Store</strong> holds the Redux state and allows access and modifications to it. It’s the middleman between actions and reducers.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>To explain what each of these does, let’s pretend we have an app with a button and a counter. Every time the user presses the button, the counter goes up by one. So if we were to build this app using Redux here is how it would work.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The user presses the button, sending (or better known as ‘dispatching’) an action</li>\\n</ol>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">App</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\">render</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// this.props.count comes from the Redux state</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>Text<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>count<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>Text<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// This.props.addToCounter() is a function to update the counter</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>Button onPress<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=></span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">addToCounter</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n        Click Me<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>Button<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// This function provides a means of sending actions so that data in the Redux store</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// can be modified.

button has been pressed.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>It’s quite straightforward once you get the hang of it. One thing I did not mention was the store. The store is something you setup and not need to worry about after. Here is how you should implement it:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> reducer <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'./reducer'</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// This connects the reducer to the store</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">default</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">configureStore</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> store <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">createStore</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>reducer<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> store\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As I said before, the store ties together actions and reducers.

Revisify has matured on the web for 2 years now and I’m in the process of building an iOS and Android app. I’m a complete newbie to app development, I only started in August 2016. After some research, I found that I had 2 options to build the app:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Native development i.e. Swift/Objective-C and Java</li>\\n<li>Hybrid development i.e. React Native, Ionic, Xamarin etc.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I decided to learn the ways of Swift and Xcode by reading the book <a href=\\\"http://amzn.eu/1SjzQhK\\\">iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a> and going through tutorials online. I liked Swift and spent 8 weeks straight learning iOS development before discovering Facebook’s framework for building apps and I quickly realised that React Native was better suited to my needs. Let me explain why.</p>\\n<h2>I can share most of the code for both iOS and Android apps</h2>\\n<p>This is the biggest advantage React Native has over traditional app development. All the code is written in Javascript which means that developers no longer have to learn Swift/Objective-C and Java as well as different concepts for each mobile platform. We don’t have to write our code twice! For small businesses like me (I’m the only person working on the app at the moment) this is a huge timesaver. This allows me to spend more time working on what matters most — improving my app and in turn bettering the user’s experience.</p>\\n<h2>React Native Apps are… Native</h2>\\n<p>There are different frameworks like <a href=\\\"https://www.ionicframwork.com\\\">Ionic</a> and <a href=\\\"https://ionicframework.com\\\">Xamarin</a> which provide a means of writing code once and deploying it to Android and iOS. In hopes of finding the best framework, I researched the pros and cons of each solution.</p>\\n<p>Ionic, unlike React Native, renders a web view rather than native code. This means that Ionic apps don’t have that ‘native’ feel to them, meaning they feel more like a web browser than an app. While this would make developing the app easier since I could just use a majority of the code from my website in the app, it wouldn’t provide the ‘app’ experience which many users are accustomed to.</p>\\n<p>Xamarin, on the other hand, uses C# to build apps that are native, just like React Native. As I’m originally a web developer, I felt more comfortable to use React Native over Xamarin. I already knew that the community for Javascript was huge and I understand the language very well. I’m sure if I were to have had a .NET development background I would have chosen Xamarin.</p>\\n<h2>The community is already very large</h2>\\n<p>While React Native is (at the time of writing this post) almost 2 years old, the support is incredible. There are currently 17,188 repositories when I search for ‘react native’ on GitHub and 10,012 questions tagged with ‘react-native’ on Stack Overflow. Just to think how new this framework is, there are already plenty of people who are working on or using React Native. As I’m building my app now, I’ve found that there are lots of libraries that have helped me to add a certain feature or to simplify my development process. The only downside is that support for the latest features in iOS and Android will take longer to work with React Native since libraries must be developed to do so. However, as the community expands further, I’m sure this delay will become much shorter.</p>\\n<h2>You can (sometimes) bypass slow App Store update approvals</h2>\\n<p>One thing that makes me nervous is the thought of pushing updates to my app and realising that there is a bug, then pushing a new update that takes around 5 to 10 days to fix it. I’m sure that vigorous testing before sending the app out to users would reduce the number of bugs, however sometimes bugs do get missed. Thankfully Microsoft created a tool, <a href=\\\"https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/\\\">CodePush</a>, that can send updates to the Javascript portion of the app instantly. While Apple is understandably a bit funny about this (they only allow you to do this if your update does not change the functionality of your app) the option to do this is very nice.</p>\\n<h2>It’s a beautiful framework and it’s easy to learn</h2>\\n<p>As I’m a web developer, I found myself right at home with React Native. If you have never used React on the web before like me, then it takes a little to adjust, but the learning curve is surprisingly minimal. React has a focus on creating reusable components like buttons, text inputs and images which makes development easy as everything is modular.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Honestly, React Native is fantastic, there are some downsides to it compared to traditional native apps, but for my needs, its advantages far outweigh its disadvantages. I genuinely believe that this is the future of app development and I’m excited to be using it for my app.</p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/the-timezone-struggle\",\"date\":\"27th December 2016\",\"title\":\"The Timezone Struggle\"},\"excerpt\":\"Something I recently found difficult to get my head around was how timezones work.

I’ve stored all the dates/times a student has tested themselves in a database, now all I need to do is get today’s date, and work backwards through the database, check if yesterday’s date is there and if so, check the previous day’s date and continue on until one of the dates is not available. However, something which I forgot about was that this would not work for students who live in a timezone other than GMT. Why? Because the server is based in the UK. The way I programmed the server is that every time a student tests themselves, the server will get the server’s date/time and logs it into the database.</p>\\n<h2>Coordinated Universal Time</h2>\\n<p>I found out that there is something called *Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) *time. Don’t ask me why it isn’t shortened down to UTC instead of CUT, <a href=\\\"https://www.timeanddate.com/time/utc-abbreviation.html\\\">you can read why here.</a> UTC is basically a global standard for timezones and it has the exact same time as GMT.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>The time in the UK as represented in UTC would simply be UTC+00:00, because as I said, UTC time is the same as GMT.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>If we wanted the time in Australia, it would be represented as UTC+09:30 as it is 9 hours and 30 minutes ahead of the time in the UK.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The time in Hawaii would be UTC-10:00 as it is 10 hours behind of the time in the UK.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Dealing with UTC Server</h2>\\n<p>Okay so back to Revisify. By knowing this, if we stored the date/time in UTC+00:00, we could then convert that to the local time of the student is located. Luckily since I only have 1 server which happens to be based in the UK, the dates in the database are already in UTC+00:00. However, I still needed to change some Python code on the server:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-python\\\"><code class=\\\"language-python\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> datetime <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> datetime\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># This gets the server time. If I moved the server to say Australia, it would not get UTC time.</span>\\ndate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> datetime<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>now<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># This gets UTC time regardless of where the server is located.</span>\\ndate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> datetime<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>utcnow<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2>Dealing with UTC Client Side</h2>\\n<p>Now that I ‘officially’ store UTC dates/times in the database, I need to convert these correctly to the student’s local time. This can be difficult to program yourself but luckily there’s a fantastic Javascript Library called <a href=\\\"http://momentjs.com/\\\">Moment.js</a> which takes out **a lot **of the strain of converting timezones. Here’s how easy it was for me to convert the UTC date/times that I got from the database into the local time of the student’s computer:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Server's UTC datetime</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> utcDate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'2016-12-20 14:56:51'</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Client's local datetime</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> localDate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> moment<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">utc</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>utcDate<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">local</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>That simple line of code is all that is needed for the client to get the right date. This library has a lot more functions but I will leave that for another time.</p>\\n<p>Back to the study streak, I updated the code so that the server sends the dates and some Javascript on the client side calculates the study streak. The final result is <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/PavSidhu/8a3b04bc7f16ba6a2eb38f6803254fda\\\">available here</a> with some annotations as to how it works.
